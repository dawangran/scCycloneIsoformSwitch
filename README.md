# scCycloneIsoformSwitch
 
The purpose of the scIsoformswitch software is to provide researchers with an efficient and accurate tool for identifying isomer conversion events in single-cell full-length transcripts. By analyzing single-cell transcriptome data, the tool enables users to discover and parse isomer transitions in intracellular transcripts, providing insight into cellular transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and the potential role of these events in development, disease, and other biological processes.
